## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A set of instructions that achieves a specific task.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function keyword, parenthesis, optional parameters, curly braces

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  Function name, parenthesis, optional arguments

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  Function definition is where the function is being declared and given parameters, while a function call is where the function is being executed and arguments are passed in.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameters are given in the function definition, while arguments are passed in for the parameters in the function call

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  They allow the function to manipulate data given by the user.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  It produces a value that can be used anywhere the function is called, and it stops the function from executing after the return statement.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  const functionName = (param1, param2) => {
  function body;
  };

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  It will have an implicit return, which means the function can return a value without using the return keyword.
