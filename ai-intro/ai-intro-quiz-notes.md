## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  My answer: AI will not replace coders, but coders who use AI will replace those who don't. Using AI effectively is key to improving the ability to work on tasks after they are learned.

  AI answer: AI is unlikely to fully replace software developers, but it will significantly change how they work by automating repetitive tasks, assisting with code generation, and improving efficiency. Developers will still be needed for creative problem-solving, designing complex systems, and ensuring AI tools are used effectively.

  Comparison: AI is a tool to make things more efficient in the world of coding, but effective use of AI still requires the developer to have a solid understanding of the concepts. However, skilled developers are always needed for problem-solving in cases where AI help can be limited.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  My answer: It's best to use AI to ask coding questions in order to gain a better understanding of coding concepts.

  AI answer: The best way to use AI tools when learning software development is to leverage them for code suggestions, debugging, and learning best practices through real-time feedback. AI can help clarify concepts, provide examples, and assist in automating repetitive tasks, allowing learners to focus on problem-solving and core programming principles.

  Comparison: The AI answer similarly states that it's best to use AI for coding questions and suggestions. It's clear from the AI answer that it should not be used to generate code, especially while still learning.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  My answer: This could potentially impede learning because it can force me to rely too much on the help of AI and prevent me from fully understanding concepts.

  AI answer: The danger of using AI tools while learning software development is that it may lead to over-reliance, preventing you from fully understanding core programming concepts and problem-solving skills. Relying too much on AI-generated code can also result in missing out on learning debugging techniques and critical thinking essential for becoming a proficient developer.

  Comparison: The AI indicates that it's important to have a solid understanding of coding concepts before using the help of AI for coding tasks, which will ensure being able to use AI effectively instead of fully relying on it.
