- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
  It is not always useful as sometimes the callback function can be written directly in an event listener argument without specifying parameters.

- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
  It would be more complicated as we would have to manually update the text content otherwise.
